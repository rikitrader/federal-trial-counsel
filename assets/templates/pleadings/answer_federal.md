(Failure to State a Claim)

     Plaintiff's claims are barred, in whole or in part, by the applicable
statute of limitations.

THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(Laches)

Plaintiff's unreasonable delay in asserting its claims and the resulting
prejudice to Defendant.

(Waiver)

     Plaintiff has waived its right to pursue the claims asserted by
[describe conduct constituting waiver].

FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(Estoppel)

     Plaintiff is estopped from pursuing its claims based on [describe
conduct giving rise to estoppel].

SIXTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(Unclean Hands)

Plaintiff engaged in inequitable conduct relating to the subject matter of
this litigation.

SEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(Failure to Mitigate)

     Plaintiff failed to mitigate its damages, and any recovery should be
reduced accordingly.

EIGHTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

recovery should be reduced or barred accordingly.

collateral estoppel based on prior litigation.

TWELFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(Standing)

     Plaintiff lacks standing to assert one or more of its claims.

THIRTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(No Damages / Speculative Damages)

     Plaintiff has not suffered any damages, or alternatively, Plaintiff's
alleged damages are speculative and not recoverable.

FOURTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### When Drafting Responses
1. **Review jurisdiction carefully** - A general denial may not preserve jurisdictional objections
2. **Be specific** - Vague denials may be deemed admissions
3. **Preserve all defenses** - Include reservation clause for defenses discovered later
4. **Consider Rule 11** - Ensure factual basis for denials

### Affirmative Defense Strategy
1. **Plead broadly initially** - Discovery may reveal support for additional defenses
2. **Update before trial** - Amend to narrow to supported defenses
3. **Don't waive** - Failure to plead may waive certain defenses
4. **Motion to strike** - Be prepared to defend against motions to strike insufficient defenses
