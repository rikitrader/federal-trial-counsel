                   III. BASIS FOR FEDERAL JURISDICTION

     [ ] A. DIVERSITY JURISDICTION (28 U.S.C. § 1332(a))

     7. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (diversity of citizenship) because:

         a. Complete diversity of citizenship exists between Plaintiff and
            Defendant; and

         b. The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest
            and costs.

                       1. Diversity of Citizenship

     8. Plaintiff {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} is a citizen of the State of
{{PLAINTIFF_STATE}} because:

         [ ] Plaintiff is an individual domiciled in {{PLAINTIFF_STATE}}.

         [ ] Plaintiff is a corporation incorporated under the laws of
             {{INCORPORATION_STATE}} with its principal place of business
             in {{PPB_STATE}}. Therefore, Plaintiff is a citizen of
             {{INCORPORATION_STATE}} and {{PPB_STATE}}.

     9. Defendant {{DEFENDANT_NAME}} is a citizen of the State of
{{DEFENDANT_STATE}} because:

         [ ] Defendant is an individual domiciled in {{DEFENDANT_STATE}}.

         [ ] Defendant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of
             {{INCORPORATION_STATE}} with its principal place of business
             in {{PPB_STATE}}. Therefore, Defendant is a citizen of
             {{INCORPORATION_STATE}} and {{PPB_STATE}}.

     10. Accordingly, complete diversity of citizenship exists between
Plaintiff and Defendant.

                      2. Amount in Controversy

     11. The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest
and costs, because:

         a. [Plaintiff's Complaint seeks damages in excess of $75,000]; or

         b. [Plaintiff's Complaint does not specify damages, but the nature
            of the claims and relief sought indicates the amount in
            controversy exceeds $75,000 based on the following:
            (i) [explain basis for amount in controversy]].

     12. In Florida, a plaintiff seeking damages in excess of $50,000 must
file suit in circuit court. Fla. Stat. § 26.012(2)(a). Plaintiff filed this
action in circuit court, indicating that the amount in controversy exceeds
$50,000.

     13. [Additional facts supporting amount in controversy]

     [ ] B. FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION (28 U.S.C. § 1331)

     14. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) because Plaintiff's claims arise under
the Constitution and laws of the United States.

     15. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts claims under [cite federal statute
or constitutional provision], which confer federal jurisdiction.

     [ ] C. CAFA JURISDICTION (28 U.S.C. § 1332(d))

     16. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 1332(d) (Class Action Fairness Act) because:

         a. This is a class action as defined by 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(1);

         b. The proposed class contains at least 100 members;

         c. Minimal diversity exists (at least one class member is diverse
            from at least one defendant); and

         d. The aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000,
            exclusive of interest and costs.

                IV. VENUE IN THIS DISTRICT

     17. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a),
which provides that removal is proper to the district court "embracing the
place where such action is pending."

     18. The state court action is pending in {{COUNTY}} County, Florida,
which is within the Middle District of Florida.

            V. CONSENT OF ALL DEFENDANTS / UNANIMITY REQUIREMENT

     19. All defendants who have been properly joined and served consent to
this removal. See 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(2)(A).

     [ ] 20. Defendant {{DEFENDANT_NAME}} is the only defendant who has been
properly joined and served, and therefore unanimity is satisfied.

     [ ] 20. All properly joined and served defendants have consented to
removal:
         - {{DEFENDANT_1}} consents (signature below / separate consent)
         - {{DEFENDANT_2}} consents (signature below / separate consent)

     [ ] 21. [Address any defendants not joining - explain why consent is
not required, e.g., improperly joined, not yet served, nominal party, etc.]

              VI. FORUM DEFENDANT RULE NOT APPLICABLE

     22. The forum defendant rule under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b)(2) does not bar
removal because:

     [ ] No defendant is a citizen of Florida; or

     [ ] [This case is removed under federal question jurisdiction, not
          diversity jurisdiction, so the forum defendant rule does not
          apply]; or

     [ ] [The forum defendant has not yet been properly served].

                    VII. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

     23. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1446(d), Defendant will promptly file a
copy of this Notice of Removal with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the
{{ORDINAL}} Judicial Circuit, in and for {{COUNTY}} County, Florida, and
serve written notice upon all adverse parties.

     24. All process, pleadings, and orders served upon Defendant in the
state court action are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

     25. A Civil Cover Sheet (Form JS-44) is filed contemporaneously
herewith.

     [ ] 26. A Corporate Disclosure Statement is filed contemporaneously
herewith, as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1.

                           CONCLUSION

     WHEREFORE, Defendant {{DEFENDANT_NAME}} hereby removes this action
from the Circuit Court of the {{ORDINAL}} Judicial Circuit, in and for
{{COUNTY}} County, Florida, to the United States District Court for the
Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, and respectfully requests

     c. Grant such other relief as is just and proper.

                                        Respectfully submitted,

                                        /s/ {{ATTORNEY_NAME}}
