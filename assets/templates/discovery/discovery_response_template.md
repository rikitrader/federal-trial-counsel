     {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}'S RESPONSES TO {{PROPOUNDING_PARTY}}'S
                    FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES

     {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby
responds to {{PROPOUNDING_PARTY}}'s First Set of Interrogatories as
follows:

                         GENERAL OBJECTIONS

     {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} makes the following general objections, which
are incorporated into each specific response:

     1. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} objects to each interrogatory to the extent
it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work
product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege.

     2. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} objects to each interrogatory to the extent
it seeks information that is neither relevant to any party's claim or
defense nor proportional to the needs of the case under Rule 26(b)(1).

     3. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} objects to each interrogatory to the extent
it is overbroad, unduly burdensome, or seeks information equally
available to the propounding party.

     4. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} objects to the definitions and instructions
to the extent they purport to impose obligations beyond those required
by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

     5. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}'s responses are based on information
currently known and reasonably available. Investigation is ongoing, and
{{RESPONDING_PARTY}} reserves the right to supplement these responses.

     The assertion of these general objections shall not be deemed a
waiver of any other objection not stated herein.
