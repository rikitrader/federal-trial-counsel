# MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

```
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
ORLANDO DIVISION

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}},
                                    Plaintiff,

v.                                              Case No. {{CASE_NO}}

{{DEFENDANT_NAME}},
                                    Defendant.
_______________________________________/

            {{PARTY_TYPE}}'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

     {{PARTY_NAME}}, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, moves
this Court for entry of summary judgment in [his/her/its] favor on
[all claims / Counts ___ through ___ / Defendant's Counterclaims]. Summary
judgment is appropriate because there is no genuine dispute as to any
material fact and {{PARTY_NAME}} is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.

                             LEGAL STANDARD

     Summary judgment is proper when "there is no genuine dispute as to
any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is "material" if it "might affect the
outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,
Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute is "genuine" if "the evidence
is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving
party." Id.

     The moving party bears the initial burden of showing "that there is
an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). Once this burden is met, the
burden shifts to the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings" and
identify specific facts showing a genuine dispute for trial. Id. at 324.

     The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some
metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co.
v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). "A mere 'scintilla' of
evidence supporting the opposing party's position will not suffice."
Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990).

                    STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS

     Pursuant to Local Rule 3.01(c), {{PARTY_NAME}} submits the following
statement of undisputed material facts:

     1. [Undisputed Fact #1]
