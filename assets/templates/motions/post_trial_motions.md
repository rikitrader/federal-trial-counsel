           SECTION 1: RENEWED MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW
                              (FRCP 50(b))
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Timing: 28 days after entry of judgment

## Prerequisite: Must have moved under Rule 50(a) at trial

```
         {{MOVANT}}'S RENEWED MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW

     {{MOVANT}}, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), moves
this Court for judgment as a matter of law and states:

I. INTRODUCTION

     During trial, {{MOVANT}} moved for judgment as a matter of law under
Rule 50(a) at [describe timing - e.g., close of Plaintiff's case, close of
all evidence]. (See Transcript at {{PAGE}}). The Court [reserved ruling /
denied the motion]. Following the jury's verdict, {{MOVANT}} now renews
that motion.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

     Under Rule 50(b), judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when
"a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis
to find for [the non-moving] party." Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). The Court
must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant,
drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. Reeves v.
Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).

     However, the Court "must disregard all evidence favorable to the
moving party that the jury is not required to believe." Id. at 151.
Judgment as a matter of law is proper where the evidence "points so
strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes
that reasonable [persons] could not arrive at a contrary verdict." Lipphardt
v. Durango Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., 267 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir. 2001).

III. ARGUMENT

     A. [Specific Claim/Element] Lacked Evidentiary Support

     [Explain why the evidence was legally insufficient to support the
verdict on this claim or element. Cite specific trial testimony and
exhibits. Explain what evidence was missing or why the evidence presented
was insufficient as a matter of law.]

     B. [Additional Arguments]

     [Continue with additional bases for judgment as a matter of law]

IV. CONCLUSION

     For these reasons, {{MOVANT}} respectfully requests that the Court
grant judgment as a matter of law in {{MOVANT}}'s favor [on Count(s) X /
on all claims / on the issue of damages].

                    ALTERNATIVE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL

     In the alternative, should the Court deny the renewed motion for
judgment as a matter of law, {{MOVANT}} moves for a new trial pursuant
to Rule 59(a) for the reasons set forth in Section 2 below.
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                   SECTION 2: MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL
                              (FRCP 59(a))
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Timing: 28 days after entry of judgment

```
                   {{MOVANT}}'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL

     {{MOVANT}}, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a), moves
this Court for a new trial and states:

I. LEGAL STANDARD

     Under Rule 59(a)(1)(A), the Court may grant a new trial "for any
reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action
at law in federal court." The decision to grant a new trial is within
the Court's discretion. Lipphardt, 267 F.3d at 1186.

     A new trial may be granted when:

     (1) The verdict is against the great weight of the evidence;
     (2) The damages are excessive or inadequate;
     (3) The trial was unfair due to error or misconduct; or
     (4) Newly discovered evidence warrants a new trial.

II. GROUNDS FOR NEW TRIAL

     [ ] A. Verdict Against the Great Weight of the Evidence

     The verdict is against the great weight of the evidence because
[explain]. "New trials should not be granted on evidentiary grounds
unless, at a minimum, the verdict is against the great—not merely the
greater—weight of the evidence." Lipphardt, 267 F.3d at 1186.

     [ ] B. Excessive Damages

     The jury's award of ${{AMOUNT}} is grossly excessive and shocks
the judicial conscience. [Explain why the damages are not supported by
the evidence. Compare to similar cases.]

     The Court should [grant a new trial on damages alone / order a
remittitur to ${{AMOUNT}}].

     [ ] C. Inadequate Damages

     The jury's award of ${{AMOUNT}} is grossly inadequate given the
evidence presented. [Explain how damages were proven at trial.]

     The Court should [grant a new trial on damages alone / order an
additur to ${{AMOUNT}}].

     [ ] D. Erroneous Jury Instructions

     The Court's instruction on [subject] was erroneous because [explain].
{{MOVANT}} objected to this instruction at [cite to record]. The error
was prejudicial because [explain how it affected the verdict].

     [ ] E. Improper Admission/Exclusion of Evidence

     The Court's [admission / exclusion] of [describe evidence] was
erroneous because [explain]. {{MOVANT}} objected at [cite to record].
The error was prejudicial because [explain].

     [ ] F. Attorney Misconduct

     [Describe the misconduct - e.g., improper closing argument, discovery
abuse, witness tampering]. {{MOVANT}} objected at [cite to record]. This
conduct was prejudicial because [explain].

     [ ] G. Juror Misconduct

     [Describe the misconduct - e.g., outside research, premature
deliberation, failure to disclose bias]. This conduct was prejudicial
because [explain].

     [ ] H. Newly Discovered Evidence

     {{MOVANT}} has discovered new evidence that could not have been
discovered before trial with reasonable diligence. The new evidence is:

     [Describe the evidence]

     This evidence is material and not cumulative, and would probably
produce a different result at a new trial.

III. CONCLUSION

     For these reasons, {{MOVANT}} respectfully requests a new trial.

           SECTION 3: MOTION TO ALTER OR AMEND JUDGMENT
                              (FRCP 59(e))
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Timing: 28 days after entry of judgment

```
              {{MOVANT}}'S MOTION TO ALTER OR AMEND JUDGMENT

     {{MOVANT}}, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), moves
this Court to alter or amend the judgment entered on {{DATE}} and states:

I. LEGAL STANDARD

     A Rule 59(e) motion may be granted to: "(1) correct manifest errors
of law or fact; (2) present newly discovered evidence; or (3) when there
is an intervening change in controlling law." Arthur v. King, 500 F.3d
1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2007).

     Rule 59(e) "may not be used to relitigate old matters, raise
argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the
entry of judgment." Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of Wellington, 408
F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir. 2005).

II. GROUNDS FOR RELIEF

     [ ] A. Manifest Error of Law

     The judgment should be amended because [explain legal error].

     [ ] B. Manifest Error of Fact

     The judgment should be amended because [explain factual error].

     [ ] C. Newly Discovered Evidence

     [Describe evidence and explain why it could not have been discovered
earlier with reasonable diligence]

     [ ] D. Intervening Change in Law

     [Cite the new controlling authority and explain its impact]

III. CONCLUSION

     {{MOVANT}} respectfully requests that the Court alter or amend the
judgment to [specify requested relief].

     (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
     (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence,

     (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;
     (4) the judgment is void;
     (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged;
         or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or
     (6) any other reason that justifies relief.

II. GROUNDS FOR RELIEF

     [ ] A. Rule 60(b)(1) - Mistake/Excusable Neglect

     [Explain the mistake or excusable neglect and how it resulted in
the judgment]

     [ ] B. Rule 60(b)(2) - Newly Discovered Evidence

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### JMOL Strategy
1. **Preserve at trial** - Move under Rule 50(a) at close of opponent's case AND at close of all evidence
2. **Be specific** - Identify each claim/element lacking sufficient evidence
3. **Cite the record** - Reference specific testimony and exhibits (or lack thereof)
4. **Standard of review** - De novo on appeal, so make the legal arguments clear

### New Trial Strategy
1. **Alternative to JMOL** - Always seek new trial in the alternative
2. **Different standard** - Court weighs evidence (doesn't view in opponent's favor)
3. **Remittitur/Additur** - Offer as alternative to full retrial on damages
4. **Preserve all errors** - Even if didn't win at trial, errors may warrant new trial

### Timing Considerations
1. **28 days is absolute** - Court cannot extend deadline
2. **File early if needed** - Don't wait until the last day
3. **Appeal clock tolled** - Notice of appeal deadline suspended until ruling
4. **Conditional rulings** - Court may rule conditionally under Rule 50(c)
