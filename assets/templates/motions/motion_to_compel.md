                  {{MOVANT}}'S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
                          AND FOR SANCTIONS

     {{MOVANT}}, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a), moves
this Court to compel {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} to provide complete responses to
[Interrogatories / Requests for Production / Requests for Admission] and
to award {{MOVANT}} reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees,
incurred in making this motion.

                              INTRODUCTION

     1. On {{SERVICE_DATE}}, {{MOVANT}} served [discovery] on
{{RESPONDING_PARTY}}.

     2. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}'s responses were due on {{DUE_DATE}}.

     3. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} [failed to respond / provided deficient
responses / asserted improper objections].

     4. Despite good faith efforts to resolve this dispute without court
intervention, {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} has refused to provide adequate
discovery responses.

                    STATEMENT OF DISCOVERY AT ISSUE

     5. The following discovery requests are at issue:

└──────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘

                         MEET AND CONFER

     6. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(1) and Local
Rule 3.01(g), the undersigned certifies that counsel conferred in good
faith with counsel for {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} in an attempt to resolve this
dispute without court intervention.

     7. On {{CONFERENCE_DATE}}, [describe meet and confer efforts -
letters, calls, meetings].

     8. Despite these efforts, the parties were unable to resolve the
dispute because {{REASON}}.

                           LEGAL STANDARD

     9. Under Rule 37(a)(3)(B), a party may move for an order compelling
discovery if another party "fails to answer an interrogatory submitted
under Rule 33" or "fails to produce documents... as requested under
Rule 34."

     10. "Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter
that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the
needs of the case." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).

     11. The party resisting discovery has the burden of showing that the
requested discovery is not relevant or is unduly burdensome. See Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C).

                               ARGUMENT

             I. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}'S OBJECTIONS ARE WITHOUT MERIT

     12. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} has objected on the grounds of [objections].
These objections are improper because:

        A. Relevance Objection

     13. The information sought is clearly relevant to [claims/defenses]
because [explain relevance].

     14. The discovery requests seek information that is [directly /
indirectly] related to [describe connection to claims].

        B. Overbreadth/Burden Objection

     15. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}'s objection that the requests are overbroad
or unduly burdensome is without merit because:

            (a) The requests are narrowly tailored to [describe scope];
            (b) {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} has not provided any evidence of burden;
            (c) The information is necessary to [describe need];
            (d) The burden is proportional to the needs of this case.

        C. Privilege Objection

     16. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} has asserted [attorney-client privilege /
work product protection] but has failed to provide a proper privilege log
as required by Rule 26(b)(5)(A).

     17. A proper privilege log must identify: (a) the document; (b) the
privilege claimed; (c) sufficient information for the court to assess the
claim. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} has failed to provide this information.

           II. {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}'S RESPONSES ARE EVASIVE
                          OR INCOMPLETE

     18. Even where {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} has purported to respond, the
responses are evasive and incomplete. Under Rule 37(a)(4), "an evasive or
incomplete disclosure, answer, or response must be treated as a failure
to disclose, answer, or respond."

     19. [Specific examples of evasive/incomplete responses]

                  III. SANCTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE

     20. Rule 37(a)(5)(A) provides that if a motion to compel is granted,
"the court must... require the party... whose conduct necessitated the
motion... to pay the movant's reasonable expenses incurred in making the
motion, including attorney's fees."

     21. {{MOVANT}} has incurred ${{AMOUNT}} in reasonable expenses in
making this motion.

     22. None of the exceptions under Rule 37(a)(5)(A)(i)-(iii) apply:

            (a) {{MOVANT}} attempted to resolve this dispute without
                court action (good faith meet and confer);

            (b) {{RESPONDING_PARTY}}'s position is not substantially
                justified; and

            (c) An award of expenses would not be unjust.

                              CONCLUSION

     WHEREFORE, {{MOVANT}} respectfully requests that this Court:

     a. GRANT this Motion to Compel;

     b. ORDER {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} to provide complete responses to
        [specify discovery] within [14/21] days;

     c. AWARD {{MOVANT}} reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees,
        in the amount of ${{AMOUNT}} (or as determined by the Court);

     d. WARN {{RESPONDING_PARTY}} that further discovery abuse may result
        in additional sanctions under Rule 37(b); and

     e. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                                        Respectfully submitted,

                                        /s/ {{ATTORNEY_NAME}}
