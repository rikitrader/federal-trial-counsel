```
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
ORLANDO DIVISION

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}},
                                    Plaintiff,

v.                                              Case No. {{CASE_NO}}

_______________________________________/

                  {{PARTY}}'S MOTIONS IN LIMINE

     {{PARTY}}, pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 104 and 401-403,
moves this Court in limine to exclude certain evidence at trial. These
motions are made to prevent the jury from being exposed to prejudicial,
irrelevant, or otherwise inadmissible evidence.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 1
           EXCLUDE REFERENCES TO [SUBJECT MATTER]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I. INTRODUCTION

     {{PARTY}} moves to exclude any reference to, or evidence of,
[describe evidence/subject matter]. Such evidence is irrelevant under
FRE 401-402 and/or substantially more prejudicial than probative under
FRE 403.

II. ARGUMENT

     A. The Evidence Is Irrelevant

     Evidence is relevant if it has "any tendency to make a fact more or
less probable than it would be without the evidence" and "the fact is of
consequence in determining the action." FRE 401. Evidence that is not
relevant is not admissible. FRE 402.

     [Explain why evidence is irrelevant to claims/defenses]

     B. Even If Relevant, The Evidence Should Be Excluded Under Rule 403

     Even if marginally relevant, the Court "may exclude relevant evidence
if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of...
unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,
wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence." FRE 403.

     [Explain why prejudice substantially outweighs probative value]

III. CONCLUSION

     For the foregoing reasons, {{PARTY}} respectfully requests that the
Court grant this motion and exclude [describe evidence].

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 2
         EXCLUDE IMPROPER CHARACTER EVIDENCE (FRE 404)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I. INTRODUCTION

     {{PARTY}} moves to exclude evidence of [prior acts / character
evidence] under Federal Rule of Evidence 404.

II. ARGUMENT

     Rule 404(a)(1) provides that "[e]vidence of a person's character or
character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion
the person acted in accordance with the character or trait."

     Rule 404(b)(1) provides that "[e]vidence of any other crime, wrong,
or act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show
that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the
character."

     [Analyze why the evidence constitutes improper character evidence]

     The evidence does not fall within any exception under Rule 404(b)(2)
(motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,
absence of mistake, or lack of accident) because [explain].

III. CONCLUSION

     This motion should be granted.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 3
              EXCLUDE HEARSAY EVIDENCE (FRE 801-802)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I. INTRODUCTION

     {{PARTY}} moves to exclude [describe hearsay statements] as
inadmissible hearsay under FRE 801-802.

II. ARGUMENT

     Hearsay is "a statement that (1) the declarant does not make while
testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in
evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement."
FRE 801(c). Hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies.
FRE 802.

     [Identify the out-of-court statement and explain how it is offered
for the truth of the matter asserted]

     No hearsay exception applies:

     [ ] Not a present sense impression (803(1))
     [ ] Not an excited utterance (803(2))
     [ ] Not a then-existing mental/physical condition (803(3))
     [ ] Not for medical diagnosis/treatment (803(4))
     [ ] Not a business record (803(6))
     [ ] Not a public record (803(8))
     [ ] Not a statement against interest (804(b)(3))
     [ ] Not a dying declaration (804(b)(2))
     [ ] Does not satisfy residual exception (807)

III. CONCLUSION

     This motion should be granted.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 4
           EXCLUDE IMPROPER EXPERT TESTIMONY (FRE 702 / DAUBERT)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I. INTRODUCTION

     {{PARTY}} moves to exclude the expert testimony of [Expert Name]
because [his/her] opinions fail to meet the requirements of Federal Rule
of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579
(1993).

II. ARGUMENT

     Under Rule 702, expert testimony is admissible only if: "(a) the
expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help
the trier of fact; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or
data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods;
and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the
facts of the case."

     The Court must act as a "gatekeeper" to ensure that expert testimony
is both relevant and reliable. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589.

     [Expert]'s testimony should be excluded because:

     [ ] The expert is not qualified in the relevant field
     [ ] The methodology is not scientifically reliable
     [ ] The methodology has not been reliably applied to the facts
     [ ] The opinions lack sufficient factual basis
     [ ] The opinions would not help the trier of fact

     [Detailed analysis of Daubert factors]

III. CONCLUSION

     This motion should be granted.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 5
         EXCLUDE SUBSEQUENT REMEDIAL MEASURES (FRE 407)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I. INTRODUCTION

     {{PARTY}} moves to exclude evidence of [describe subsequent measures]
under Federal Rule of Evidence 407.

II. ARGUMENT

     Rule 407 provides: "When measures are taken that would have made an
earlier injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent
measures is not admissible to prove: negligence; culpable conduct; a
defect in a product or its design; or a need for a warning or instruction."

     [Explain how the evidence constitutes subsequent remedial measures]

     The evidence is not offered for a permitted purpose (impeachment,
proving ownership/control, or proving feasibility if disputed).

III. CONCLUSION

     This motion should be granted.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 6
         EXCLUDE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS (FRE 408)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I. INTRODUCTION

     {{PARTY}} moves to exclude evidence of settlement negotiations and
offers under Federal Rule of Evidence 408.

II. ARGUMENT

     Rule 408 prohibits the use of settlement offers, acceptances, and
conduct or statements made during settlement negotiations to prove or
disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a
prior inconsistent statement or contradiction.

     [Describe the settlement communications at issue]

III. CONCLUSION

     This motion should be granted.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOTION IN LIMINE NO. 7
         EXCLUDE [ADDITIONAL CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Continue with additional motions as needed]

                                        Respectfully submitted,
