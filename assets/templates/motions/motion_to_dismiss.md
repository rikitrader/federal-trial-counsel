# MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER RULE 12(b)(6)

```
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
ORLANDO DIVISION

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}},
                                    Plaintiff,

v.                                              Case No. {{CASE_NO}}

{{DEFENDANT_NAME}},
                                    Defendant.
_______________________________________/

            DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT

     Defendant, {{DEFENDANT_NAME}}, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff's
Complaint with prejudice. In support thereof, Defendant states as follows:

                              INTRODUCTION

     1. Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted. Despite [X] pages of allegations, Plaintiff has not pled facts
sufficient to satisfy the plausibility standard required under Bell Atlantic
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662
(2009).

     2. [Brief summary of why Complaint fails]

                             LEGAL STANDARD

     3. To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint
must contain "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on
its face." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. "A claim has facial plausibility when
the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct
alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.

     4. In applying this standard, courts follow a two-pronged approach:
First, courts "identify[] pleadings that, because they are no more than
conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth." Id. at 679.
Second, "[w]hen there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should
assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise
to an entitlement to relief." Id.

     5. "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported
by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. at 678. "[W]here the
well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere
possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not
'show[n]'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Id. at 679 (quoting
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).

                               ARGUMENT

                    I. COUNT I SHOULD BE DISMISSED
                        [TITLE OF COUNT I]

     6. To state a claim for [cause of action], a plaintiff must allege:
        (a) [First element];
        (b) [Second element];
        (c) [Third element]; and
        (d) [Fourth element].
     [Cite controlling authority].

     7. Plaintiff's Complaint fails to adequately plead [element(s)].

     8. [Analyze why allegations are insufficient]:

        a. Plaintiff merely recites the legal standard without providing
           factual support. [Cite specific paragraphs].

        b. Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and not entitled to the
           assumption of truth. [Explain].

        c. Even accepting Plaintiff's factual allegations as true, they do
           not plausibly support an inference of [defendant's liability].

     9. [Continue analysis for each deficient element]

                   II. COUNT II SHOULD BE DISMISSED
                        [TITLE OF COUNT II]

     10. Count II asserts a claim for [cause of action].

     11. To state such a claim, a plaintiff must plead:
         (a) [Element]; and
         (b) [Element].
     [Cite authority].

     12. Plaintiff fails to allege [missing element(s)] because:
         [Explain deficiency]

                  III. COUNT III SHOULD BE DISMISSED
                        [TITLE OF COUNT III]

     13. [Repeat analysis for each count]

            IV. ALTERNATIVELY, PLAINTIFF SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO
                      PROVIDE A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT

     14. In the alternative, if the Court does not dismiss the Complaint,
Defendant respectfully requests that Plaintiff be required to provide a
more definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e).

     15. Plaintiff's Complaint is so vague and ambiguous that Defendant
cannot reasonably prepare a response. [Explain specific deficiencies].

             V. DISMISSAL SHOULD BE WITH PREJUDICE

     16. Dismissal should be with prejudice because amendment would be
futile. [Explain why Plaintiff cannot cure deficiencies].

     17. Alternatively, if the Court grants leave to amend, Plaintiff
should be given only one opportunity to replead, with any amended
complaint due within [14/21] days.

                              CONCLUSION

     WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court:

     a. Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint in its entirety with prejudice;

     b. In the alternative, dismiss specific counts as identified above;

     c. In the further alternative, order Plaintiff to provide a more
        definite statement; and

     d. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                                        Respectfully submitted,

                                        /s/ {{ATTORNEY_NAME}}

## 12(b)(1) - SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION

```
                    I. THIS COURT LACKS SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION

     [For Diversity Cases]

     A. Complete Diversity Does Not Exist

     1. Plaintiff is a citizen of [State].

     2. Defendant is also a citizen of [same State].

     3. Because Plaintiff and Defendant are citizens of the same state,
complete diversity does not exist, and this Court lacks diversity
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).

     B. Amount in Controversy Is Not Met

     4. The amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000.

     5. [Explain why damages fall below threshold]

     [For Federal Question Cases]

     C. No Federal Question Exists

     6. Plaintiff's claims arise entirely under state law.

     7. The fact that Plaintiff references federal law does not create
federal question jurisdiction where federal law is not an essential
element of the claims asserted. [Cite Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc.
v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308 (2005)].
