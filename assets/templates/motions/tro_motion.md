UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
ORLANDO DIVISION

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}},
                                    Plaintiff,

v.                                              Case No. {{CASE_NO}}

{{DEFENDANT_NAME}},
                                    Defendant.
_______________________________________/

         PLAINTIFF'S EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
                      AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

     Plaintiff, {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}, respectfully moves this Court, pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, for entry of a Temporary Restraining Order
("TRO") and, following a hearing, a Preliminary Injunction, enjoining Defendant,
{{DEFENDANT_NAME}}, from [describe conduct to be enjoined]. In support thereof,
Plaintiff states as follows:

                              INTRODUCTION

     1. This is an emergency motion. Plaintiff seeks immediate injunctive
relief to prevent [describe irreparable harm]. Absent immediate relief,
Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm that cannot be remedied by monetary
damages.

     2. Plaintiff has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of
[his/her/its] claims for [identify claims].

                            FACTUAL BACKGROUND

     3. [State facts giving rise to the need for emergency relief]

     4. [Describe the conduct Plaintiff seeks to enjoin]

     5. [Explain why the harm is imminent and irreparable]

                             LEGAL STANDARD

     6. Under Rule 65, a party seeking a TRO or preliminary injunction must
demonstrate: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that
irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3) that the
threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed
injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) that the injunction would not
be adverse to the public interest. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir.
2000).

                               ARGUMENT

                 I. PLAINTIFF IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS

     7. To establish a likelihood of success, a plaintiff need not prove
[his/her/its] case in full. Rather, the plaintiff must present a substantial
case on the merits. Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223, 1232
(11th Cir. 2005).

     8. [Analyze likelihood of success for each claim]

     9. [Cite supporting case law]

            II. PLAINTIFF WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM ABSENT RELIEF

     10. "The basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has always
been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal remedies." Sampson v. Murray,
415 U.S. 61, 88 (1974).

     11. [Describe the irreparable nature of the harm]

     12. The following harms cannot be remedied by monetary damages:
         a. [List specific harms]
         b. [Loss of constitutional rights is per se irreparable]
         c. [Loss of goodwill/reputation]
         d. [Threatened violations of statutory rights]

     13. The harm is imminent because [explain immediacy].

                   III. THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS FAVORS PLAINTIFF

     14. The balance of hardships tips decidedly in Plaintiff's favor.

     15. Plaintiff faces [describe harms to Plaintiff without injunction].

     16. Defendant, by contrast, will suffer [minimal/no] harm from being
required to [comply with the injunction]. The injunction merely requires
Defendant to [describe what injunction requires].

                     IV. THE PUBLIC INTEREST SUPPORTS RELIEF

     17. The public interest is served by [enforcing the law / protecting
constitutional rights / maintaining the status quo].

     18. "The public interest is served by the enforcement of [federal
statutes]." [Cite case].

              V. NO NOTICE SHOULD BE REQUIRED / NOTICE WAS PROVIDED

     [ ] No Notice Required:

     19. Pursuant to Rule 65(b)(1), a TRO may issue without notice to the
adverse party if:

         (A) specific facts in an affidavit or verified complaint clearly
             show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage
             will result to the movant before the adverse party can be
             heard in opposition; and

         (B) the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made
             to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.

     20. [Explain why notice cannot be given or should not be required]

     [ ] Notice Was Provided:

     21. Notice of this motion was provided to Defendant on [date] by
[method]. [Attach proof of service].

                      VI. SECURITY UNDER RULE 65(c)

     22. Plaintiff is prepared to post security in an amount the Court
deems appropriate. Plaintiff respectfully submits that a bond in the amount
of $[amount] is sufficient to protect Defendant against any wrongful
issuance of the injunction.

                              CONCLUSION

     WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

     a. Issue a Temporary Restraining Order immediately enjoining Defendant
        from [specific conduct];

     b. Schedule an expedited hearing on Plaintiff's motion for preliminary
        injunction;

     c. Following hearing, issue a Preliminary Injunction maintaining the
        status quo pending resolution of this action;

     d. Set an appropriate bond under Rule 65(c); and

     e. Grant such other relief as is just and proper.

                                        Respectfully submitted,
