             PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

     Plaintiff, {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 65(a), moves this Court for entry of a Preliminary Injunction
enjoining Defendant from [describe conduct]. In support, Plaintiff states:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                              INTRODUCTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

resolution of this case. Without preliminary injunctive relief, Plaintiff

injunctive relief under the Supreme Court's Winter decision and Eleventh
Circuit precedent.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                         FACTUAL BACKGROUND
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     3. [Describe relevant factual background]

     4. [Describe the conduct sought to be enjoined]

     5. [Describe the harm that will occur absent injunction]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                           LEGAL STANDARD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     6. "A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish
that [1] he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] he is likely to
suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] the
balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] an injunction is in the
public interest." Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7,
20 (2008).

     7. In the Eleventh Circuit, "a preliminary injunction is an
extraordinary and drastic remedy not to be granted unless the movant
clearly establishes the burden of persuasion as to each of the four
prerequisites." Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000)
(en banc) (internal quotation omitted).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                               ARGUMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

          I. PLAINTIFF IS SUBSTANTIALLY LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS

     8. A plaintiff seeking preliminary relief "need not prove his case
in full." McDonald's Corp. v. Robertson, 147 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.
1998). Rather, the plaintiff must present "a substantial case on the
merits." Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th
Cir. 2005).

                         A. [First Claim]

     9. To prevail on a claim for [cause of action], Plaintiff must show:
(1) [element]; (2) [element]; (3) [element]; and (4) [element]. [Cite].

     10. Plaintiff is likely to establish each element:

        Element 1: [Analysis with evidence]

        Element 2: [Analysis with evidence]

        Element 3: [Analysis with evidence]

        Element 4: [Analysis with evidence]

                         B. [Second Claim, if applicable]

     11. [Analysis of additional claims]

                         C. Defendant's Likely Defenses

     12. Defendant will likely assert [defenses]. These defenses are
unlikely to prevail because [analysis].

             II. PLAINTIFF WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM ABSENT
                       PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

     13. "The basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has always
been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal remedies." Sampson v.
Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 88 (1974).

     14. Irreparable harm is harm that "cannot be undone through monetary
remedies." Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass'n of Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City
of Jacksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. 1990).

     15. Absent preliminary relief, Plaintiff will suffer the following
irreparable harms:

├────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Harm 2 - e.g., Loss of        │ [Customers/relationships, once lost, may  │

└────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────┘

     16. The harm is imminent because [explain imminence].

     17. Monetary damages are inadequate because [explain inadequacy].

              III. THE BALANCE OF EQUITIES FAVORS PLAINTIFF

     18. "In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should
pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the
extraordinary remedy of injunction." Winter, 555 U.S. at 24.

     19. The balance of hardships tips decidedly in Plaintiff's favor:

│                                     │ with law/contract]                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Describe harm 2]                   │ [Defendant has no right to engage     │

└─────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘

     20. "When the defendant's actions are of the type that are likely
to cause irreparable harm, a substantial likelihood of success warrants
preliminary injunctive relief." Georgia Soc'y of Plastic Surgeons, Inc.
v. Anderson, 363 F.3d 1094, 1101 (11th Cir. 2004).

              IV. THE PUBLIC INTEREST SUPPORTS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

     21. "The public interest is served by the enforcement of [the law]."
[Cite relevant authority].

     22. The public interest supports this injunction because:

        (a) [Public interest factor 1 - e.g., enforcement of contracts];
        (b) [Public interest factor 2 - e.g., protection of property rights];
        (c) [Public interest factor 3 - e.g., maintaining integrity of courts].

                    V. SECURITY UNDER RULE 65(c)

     23. Rule 65(c) provides that the court may issue a preliminary
injunction "only if the movant gives security in an amount that the
court considers proper."

     24. Plaintiff is prepared to post a bond in the amount of ${{AMOUNT}},
which is sufficient to compensate Defendant for any damages wrongfully
sustained.
