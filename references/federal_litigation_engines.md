# Federal Litigation Strategy Engines

Comprehensive analytical modules for federal civil litigation from complaint through appeal.

---

## Module 1: Federal Defense Matrix

### Role
Senior federal defense attorney and motion-to-dismiss strategist.

### Goal
Identify ALL defenses commonly raised in U.S. federal litigation and generate a preemptive counter-strategy.

### Analysis Framework

#### 1.1 Rule 12(b) Defenses

| Defense | Basis | Counter-Strategy |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| **12(b)(1)** | Subject-matter jurisdiction defects | Verify federal question or diversity; allege citizenship and amount |
| **12(b)(2)** | Personal jurisdiction | Establish minimum contacts; specific jurisdiction; consent |
| **12(b)(3)** | Improper venue | Verify 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) basis; events or defendant location |
| **12(b)(4)-(5)** | Service defects | Verify FRCP 4 compliance; correct and re-serve |
| **12(b)(6)** | Failure to state a claim | Plead specific facts for each element; satisfy Twombly/Iqbal |
| **12(b)(7)** | Required party missing | Analyze FRCP 19; join or explain why not feasible |

#### 1.2 Immunity Analysis

| Immunity Type | Applicability | Counter-Strategy |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Sovereign** | Federal/state defendants | Identify waiver; FTCA; sue official capacity |
| **Qualified** | Individual officers | Clearly established law; factual similarity |
| **Absolute Judicial** | Judges | Non-judicial acts; absence of jurisdiction |
| **Absolute Prosecutorial** | Prosecutors | Administrative/investigative functions |
| **Absolute Legislative** | Legislators | Non-legislative acts |
| **Eleventh Amendment** | State entities | Ex parte Young; Congressional abrogation |

#### 1.3 Procedural Defenses

- **Statute of Limitations**: Calculate from accrual; identify tolling
- **Exhaustion**: EEOC, FTCA SF-95, ERISA, PLRA
- **Pre-suit Notice**: State tort claims; FTCA presentment
- **Res Judicata**: Same claim, same parties, final judgment
- **Collateral Estoppel**: Same issue actually litigated
- **Rooker-Feldman**: State court judgment review in federal court
- **Younger Abstention**: Pending state proceedings
- **Mootness/Ripeness**: Live controversy; concrete harm

#### 1.4 Pleading Attack Checklist

- [ ] Each element supported by factual allegations?
- [ ] Legal conclusions identified and disregarded?
- [ ] Plausibility standard met (more than possible)?
- [ ] Rule 9(b) satisfied for fraud claims?
- [ ] Monell policy/custom alleged for municipal liability?
- [ ] Causation clearly linked?

#### 1.5 Strategic Risk Score

Calculate vulnerability 0-100:
- Standing issues: +20
- Immunity exposure: +25
- Exhaustion gaps: +20
- SOL concerns: +15
- Pleading deficiencies: +20

- [ ] No discretionary dismissal factors (§ 1367(c))?

### 2.2 Standing Traps

| Element | Question | Red Flag |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Injury in Fact** | Concrete, particularized harm? | Speculative or future harm |
| **Traceability** | Fairly traceable to defendant? | Third-party causation |
| **Redressability** | Court can remedy? | Independent obstacles |
| **Organizational** | Members harmed? Diversion of resources? | No individual harm |
| **Taxpayer** | Establishment Clause only? | General grievance |

### 2.3 Exhaustion Matrix

| Claim Type | Exhaustion Requirement | Deadline |
|------------|------------------------|----------|
| Title VII | EEOC charge | 180/300 days from adverse action |
| ADEA | EEOC charge | 180/300 days |
| ADA | EEOC charge | 180/300 days |
| FTCA | SF-95 admin claim | 2 years from accrual |
| ERISA | Internal appeal | Per plan terms |
| Prisoner § 1983 | PLRA administrative | Before filing suit |
| Immigration | BIA appeal | Varies |

### 2.4 Abstention Doctrines

| Doctrine | When Applies | Effect |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Younger** | Pending state criminal/civil/admin proceedings | Dismiss or stay |
| **Pullman** | Unsettled state law may resolve federal issue | Certify or stay |

## Module 19: Voir Dire Strategy Engine

### Goal
Design jury selection strategy and bias detection questions.

### 19.1 Juror Risk Profile Matrix

| Risk Factor | Detection Questions | Strike Priority |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Anti-lawsuit Bias** | "Have you ever felt lawsuits have gotten out of hand?" | Cause/Peremptory |
| **Government Trust Bias** | "Do you believe police officers are generally truthful?" | Peremptory |
| **Corporate Loyalty** | "Do you work for a company that has been sued?" | Assess impact |
| **Personal Injury Skepticism** | "Do you believe some people exaggerate injuries?" | High priority |
| **Authority Deference** | "Do you generally defer to expert opinions?" | Context-dependent |

### 19.2 Favorable Juror Indicators

**For Plaintiff (Civil Rights):**
- Personal experience with government overreach
- Empathy indicators (caregiving roles)
- Rule-following mindset (expects accountability)
- Diverse life experiences
- Community involvement

**For Plaintiff (Employment):**
- Prior workplace conflict
- Management skepticism
- Union membership/support
- Small business perspective

### 19.3 Bias Detection Question Bank

**Open-Ended Questions:**
1. "Tell me about a time when you felt someone in authority treated you unfairly."
2. "What comes to mind when you hear the phrase 'police brutality'?"
3. "How do you feel about people who sue large corporations?"
4. "What experience have you had with the legal system?"
5. "If you were injured by someone's negligence, would you hesitate to file a lawsuit?"

**Theme Testing Questions:**
1. "Do you believe that rules apply equally to everyone, including police officers?"
2. "Would you have difficulty awarding significant damages if the evidence supported it?"
3. "Can you follow the law even if you personally disagree with it?"

### 19.4 Cause Challenge Framework

| Bias | Legal Standard | Sample Questions |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **Actual Bias** | Cannot be impartial | "Can you set aside that experience?" |
| **Implied Bias** | Relationship/interest | "Do you know any parties or witnesses?" |
| **Inferable Bias** | Strong circumstantial | Pattern of responses showing inability |

### 19.5 Jury Composition Strategy

**Ideal Panel Composition:**
- Mix of life experiences
- Balance of personalities (leaders + followers)
- At least one natural plaintiff advocate
- No extreme anti-lawsuit jurors
- Educated enough to understand evidence

### 19.6 Voir Dire Execution Tips

1. **Build Rapport First**: Start with non-threatening questions
2. **Listen More Than Talk**: Let jurors reveal themselves
3. **Rehabilitate Strategically**: Fix fixable jurors; don't waste strikes
4. **Watch Body Language**: Non-verbal cues reveal more than words
5. **Use Challenges Wisely**: Save peremptories for high-risk jurors
6. **Take Notes**: Track responses systematically
7. **Coordinate Strikes**: Ensure no duplication with co-counsel

### 19.7 Voir Dire Risk Score

Calculate probability of favorable panel:
- Base: 50%
- Adjust for venue demographics: +/-10%
- Adjust for case type: +/-15%
- Adjust for judge's voir dire style: +/-10%
- Adjust for opposing counsel skill: +/-15%
